                    The concept of transforming waste into something valuable is not only environmentally conscious but also creatively inspiring. In today's world, where sustainability and resourcefulness are paramount, innovative ideas like crafting a bag from discarded fire hoses, fashioning diamonds from organic food waste, or even constructing bicycles from old gears demonstrate the incredible potential of repurposing materials. These endeavors not only reduce the burden on landfills but also highlight the ingenuity of individuals and their ability to turn seemingly worthless items into meaningful and functional products. From toys carved from wood scraps to 3D-printed plates created from plastic caps, and even jewelry fashioned from coffee caps, the possibilities for turning trash into treasures are endless.

                    The idea of creating jewelry from coffee caps and floor tiles has proven to be a brilliant concept, offering a seamless transition from conventional waste to innovative and environmentally conscious design. By repurposing these seemingly ordinary materials, you not only reduce waste but also craft unique, eco-friendly pieces that make a statement. Coffee caps can be transformed into stylish earrings, pendants, or beadwork, while floor tiles can be cut into geometric shapes for modern, eye-catching designs. It's a fantastic way to embrace a sustainable lifestyle, express your artistic flair, and promote environmental responsibility, all while fashioning beautiful pieces with a compelling story of recycling and upcycling at their core.

                Using Midjourney and its technique of weighting certain words, it is possible to create a variety of jewelry designs. This method allows for the customization and generation of unique jewelry pieces by emphasizing specific words in the prompt, thereby influencing the style, material, and overall appearance of the jewelry in the generated designs.

                    Starting with used coffee capsules and old floor tiles, our persona hands-in both to our recycling store. She either is payed a small amount of money for handing in her waste (incentive!) or the materials remain her's and she can design how the final product should look like. No more side products are needed!
                    While the capsules need to be washed first, they afterwards are pressed and painted. That is, they need to go down until recycling. Floor tiles, however, just need to be cut into appropriate size, i.e., no recycling is needed. After advertising the new product, it is sold online. Finally, the client is waiting excitedly for her new jewellery to be delivered.

                <p>
                    The first touchpoint in the customer experience is collecting all products before recycling. Coffee capsules are easily collected through daily customer use. In contrast, floor tiles are removed during building renovations, which few people do every day. Therefore, a concept store where customers and also professionals can meet to retrieve all tiles that will not be reused in their original purpose can be created. In a second step, clients can help designing and assembling of the remanufactured tiles with the recycled capsules themselves. Real beauty lasts forever!
