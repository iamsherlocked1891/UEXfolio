                    The project envisions a unique and innovative addition above the stadium, utilizing the ample open space to create something both functional and visually striking. This design incorporates a lightweight, transparent structure that gracefully floats above the stadium, reminiscent of a cloud. The use of tensioned fabric and lightweight steel, combined with transparent panels, contributes to the ethereal and airy quality of the structure. It is anchored securely to the stadium, ensuring stability while maintaining a sense of seamless integration with the existing architecture. The interior of this cloud-like pavilion is designed as a flexible exhibition space, bathed in natural light, making it an ideal venue for various events and displays.
