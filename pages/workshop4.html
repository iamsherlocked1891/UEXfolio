                    Urine cup disposal and instructions machine

                    This is an automatic urine cup machine used in medical settings. It consists of a machine body with a bracket, a module for storing and retrieving urine cups, and a mechanical arm. The device can detect when a user needs a cup and automatically provides one. It communicates cup availability through Bluetooth to healthcare workers and allows for control of information and education content. A mechanical arm dispenses the cups, making it convenient for users, while healthcare staff can interact with users through audio and visual prompts. This device effectively solves the problem of running out of urine cups in medical settings.

                    Urine collection is a common healthcare procedure but it often entails an uncomfortably awkward and intimate experience for patients. Traditionally, patients are required to retrieve an empty cup, fill it with their urine sample, manually inscribe their name, and return it to hospital staff. This process is both physically and emotionally uncomfortable, as it requires patients to engage in a personal and private act.
                    Patients struggle with the appropriate amount of urine to collect and how to perform the collection accurately. The procedure is highly private, making the reduction of human interaction and conversation a desirable feature.

                <p>
                    Our solution is an innovative automatic urine cup disposal and collection device. This machine records patient data, disposes cups, provides instructions for sample collection, and offers instant test results or informs patients of the expected wait time for their results.

                    The chosen style for our project is modern and soft, characterized by a porcelain texture and a clean, hygienic feel. We incorporated the color pink to evoke warmth and compassion in the AI-monitored interaction screen, creating a welcoming and supportive atmosphere in healthcare settings.

                <p>
                    This style embraces minimalism, emphasizing simplicity and functionality, and signifies a departure from the traditional sterile hospital aesthetic. Our goal is to shift towards a patient-centered approach that enhances the emotional well-being of patients and challenges the impersonal stereotypes associated with hospitals.
